# Search toggle

Starter for adding a search form which can be toggled. Made for WordPress with [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber).

## Usage

Since this is a starter there is no installer available, to keep everything as flexible as possible. The average workflow will probably be the following:

1. Including the template: `{% include 'search-form.twig' %}`
2. Including the script: `import './search-form'`
3. Including the styling: `@import 'search-form';`, and changing some variables (like `$border` and `$dimension`)
